# sfcn-opi
This is an implmentation of SFCN-OPI on Python3, Keras and TensorFlow. 
For details about the SFCN-OPI architecture please refer to the paper [SFCN-OPI: Detection and Fine-grained Classification of Nuclei Using
Sibling FCN with Objectness Prior Interaction.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.08297.pdf)

### Requirement
In addition to python3.5, tensorflow and keras, 
you can installed the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 under virtualenv
 
 
 
 
### Dataset
We use CRCHistoPhenotypes to test our model.
This dataset involves 100 H&E stained histology images of colorectal adenocarcinomas.
 A total of 29,756 nuclei were marked at/around the center for detection purposes. 
 Out of these, there were 22,444 nuclei that also have an associated class label,
 i.e. epithelial, inflammatory, fibroblast, and miscellaneous.

 You can use masks_creation.py and function in utils.py to do data preprocessing for you.
 
 
 # loss function for classification looks problematic, since it do not use y_true.
